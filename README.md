The logical entity comprises of methods like create, display and raiseSalary which can be called in the user logic.

If they choose create or display the details like name, age, salary, designation will be displayed.

If your choice is raisedSalary it displays the statement just salary raised.

We need to create a user logic which consists of main method which helps to execute the program.

The object is created here to store the inputs given by user according to user.

We need to use scanner class in user logic to take the inputs i.e., choice from the user with the help of another local variable choice and another local variable boolean b is used to check the condition.

We use do while for infinite nimber of iterations and switch condition statement is used to perform equality check between the output expression and also the value presnt in the case.

If the choice is exit then it comes out of the loop.Thus the execution happens according to above given conditions.
